Algoithms
=========

Small collection of useful algorithms in a variety of languages (I lie, mostly coffeescript...)

Most of the included files are gists, so a clone should be made using a `git clone --recursive <link>` command. Notice the `--recursive`, otherwise there will be a lot of empty folders.
